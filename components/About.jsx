          I'm a software developer with a background in web design. After
          gaining experience in creating static websites and CMS-based web
          applications, I decided to go beyond informational websites and focus
          on building web applications that people can actually use in their
          day-to-day lives.

          To make the transition to a full-stack software developer, I joined a
          coding bootcamp at Lighthouse Labs in 2023. It was an eye-opening
          experience that provided me with a broader perspective on the field. I
          am continuously expanding my skill set by learning new technologies
          every day.
